   If you do not want to be subject to the GNU AGPL and you do not want to release the source code of your proprietary application, you should purchase a commercial license from the author.
 
   Please send an e-mail to the author including your legal name, address, the name of the product you are interested in, and the version number you want to use. The process only takes a couple of e-mails, you pay via PayPal, and you are immediately good to go.

   The commercial license grants you as an individual or as an organization the right to use the software forever, and for any purpose, except reselling it or re-offering its functionality to third parties via your own software.

   The commercial license is issued for a specific version of the software. If you wish to use another version, you need a new license. This is necessary in order to fund the continuous development of the software.

If you use the software without taking any action regarding licensing, then the license which applies by default is the GNU AGPL licence.
